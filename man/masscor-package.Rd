\title{\code{masscor}: Mass Measurement Corrections and Uncertainties Using Balance Calibration Data.}
\description{
The \code{masscor} package implements
}
\section{\code{masscor} functions}{

This package uses list objects of class \code{'calibCert'} to store information of balance calibration certificates.
The functions use the information of this object to convert balance reading indications to conventional mass and calculate mass
uncertainties. Several models for calculating air density are included and this information can be used to calculate the
Magnitude of Air Buoyancy Correction (MABC). Uncertainties calculations are made using Gauss Approximation according to the
Guide to the expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM) implemented in R by the package
\link[propagate]{propagate} (Spiess, 2018).

\section{Disclaimer}{

The Instituto Nacional de Metrologia de Colombia (INM) has published this package to ease several calculations
involved in corrections for mass measurements. We endeavor to update on a regular basis, but cannot guarantee
the accuracy of all implemented methods. Any reference to commercial measurement instruments does not imply any approval,
endorsement or recommendation by the INM.
