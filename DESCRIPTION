Description: Mass measurement corrections and uncertainties using
    calibration data, as recommended by EURAMET's guideline No. 18 (2015)
    <isbn:978-3-942992-40-4>. The package provides classes and methods to store
    information of balance calibration certificates and to ease the
    calculations of conventional mass, local air density using environmental
    conditions, and the magnitude of air buoyancy correction.
